![Preview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/add3ff6e-3465-4b02-bc89-8e230388c75b)

> Built this as one of my first full-stack projects – a functional clone of Google Forms with form creation, sign-in, and form management. React + Bootstrap on the frontend, and a local `json-server` as a makeshift backend. Let’s just say it was my bootstrapped backend era 😄.
